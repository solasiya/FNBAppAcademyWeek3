                <h3>DUSKY LEAF MONKEYS</h3>
                <p>The dusky leaf monkey, spectacled langur, or spectacled leaf monkey (Trachypithecus obscurus) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is found in Malaysia, Burma, and Thailand.</p>
                <p>Dusky leaf monkeys are medium-sized primates with a distinctive appearance. They have a dark gray to black fur coat, with a lighter face and distinctive white eye rings that give them a "spectacled" look. Their long tails are often longer than their bodies, and they have strong limbs adapted for climbing.</p>
                <p>These monkeys are primarily arboreal, spending most of their time in trees. They are known for their agility and acrobatic skills, moving swiftly through the canopy. Their diet consists mainly of leaves, fruits, and flowers, which they forage for in the treetops.</p>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the monkeys at the monkey cage near the Monkey Trail.</p>
